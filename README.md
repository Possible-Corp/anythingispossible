Hello!

This is primarily a non-code project, consisting of research, spreadsheets, papers, and presentations.

We're using a Google Drive repository to store and manage these artifacts: https://tinyurl.com/possiblecorp

Eventually we'll add a variety of applications to help manage operations for the proposed climate-healing facilities
